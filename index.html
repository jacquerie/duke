      <h1>Who killed the Duke of Densmore?</h1>
      <hr />
      <p class="alert alert-info">This post is an adaptation of
      <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~marcotte/IFT1063/ARCHIVES_1063/DucDensmore.pdf">"Qui a tué le Duc de Densmore?"</a>, a summary of the
      homonymous short story by Claude Berge.</p>
      <p>One day Sherlock Holmes received the visit of his friend
      Watson, who was asked to investigate on a murder that had gone
      unsolved for more than ten years.</p>
      <p>At the time, the Duke of Densmore had been killed by a bomb
      powerful enough to destroy the castle where he had been living
      since retirement. Newspapers wrote that his testament, also
      destroyed in the explosion, was very harsh on one of his seven
      ex-viwes. Despite this, the Duke had invited all of them in his
      Scottish castle a few days before dying.</p>
      <p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Holmes:</span> I remember
      this case. What's strange is that the bomb was manifactured to fit,
      perfectly hidden, in one of the armors of the bedroom, which implies
      that the murderer must have been several times to the castle.</p>
      <p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Watson:</span> Of course,
      and for this reason I interrogated each woman: Ann, Betty, Charlotte,
      Edith, Felicia, Georgia and Helen. They all swore that they had been
      to Densmore's castle exactly once in their lifetimes.</p>
      <p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Holmes:</span> Mh. Did you
      ask them the precise dates of their respective stays?</p>
      <p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Watson:</span> Alas! No one
      could remember them after more than ten years. Nevertheless, I asked
      them who they had met there:</p>
      <pre class="meetings">Ann met Betty, Charlotte, Felicia and Georgia.
Betty met Ann, Charlotte, Edith, Felicia and Helen.
Charlotte met Ann, Betty and Edith.
Edith met Betty, Charlotte and Felicia.
Felicia met Ann, Betty, Edith and Helen.
Georgia met Ann and Helen.
Helen met Betty, Felicia and Georgia.</pre>
      <p><strong>Watson:</strong> As you can see, my dear Holmes, their
      answers match.</p>
      <p>Holmes then took a pencil and drew this strange picture:</p>
      <img src="img/densmore_graph.png" alt="A graph representing the meetings
      that took place in Densmore's castle." />
      <p>Then, after staring at it for less than thirty seconds, he
      shouted:</p>
      <p><strong>Holmes:</strong> Well, well! Mister Watson, what you just
      told me determines uniquely the identity of the killer!</p>
      <p>Who is the murderer, and how many times (at least) did she
      snuck into the castle?</p>
      <p class="solution">If you think you know the answer, tweet 
      it by clicking
